Hi, I'm Nico, and I work as an Associate Professor at University of Santiago de Compostela. I'm also affiliated with [CiTIUS](https://citius.gal/team/nicolas-vila-blanco/), the Research Center for Intelligent Technologies. My research focuses on the intersection of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Medical Imaging.
